docker compose exec app composer install

# Generate app key
docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate --force

# Run migrations
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate

# Run seeders
docker compose exec app php artisan db:seed

# Generate Swagger docs
docker compose exec app php artisan l5-swagger:generate

DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=tech_test
DB_USERNAME=user
DB_PASSWORD=root
```

## Useful commands inside app container

## API overview

### Availability

#### GET /{carPark}/availability?from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD

### Bookings

#### POST /{carPark}/bookings (create)

#### PATCH /bookings/{booking} (amend)

#### POST /bookings/{booking}/cancel (cancel)

## 8) CI

## The project is set up to run:

#### Pint (coding standards): vendor/bin/pint --test

#### PHPStan (static analysis): vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=1G

#### Tests: php artisan test

#### You can run the same commands locally using the snippets above.

## Implementation limitations

#### A few notes on the current implementation:

-   Seasons: the system assumes that only one season can be active at a time. Handling overlaps or more complex rules between seasons is not implemented.

-   Users & security: bookings are implemented for guests only, without user accounts, authentication, or permissions.

-   Rate limiting & hardening: there is no rate limiting, throttling, or additional security layers in place.

#### These areas could be extended in the future, along with improvements to the overall architecture (e.g. stricter separation of domains, clearer layering, and more robust validation and error handling) to make the system production-ready.
